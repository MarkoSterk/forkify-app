A JavaScript recipe application which allows the user to get recipies from an API, and add their own recipies to the application.

It follows the MVC architecture and uses some advanced JS features.

A demo of the app is accessible at: https://forkify-marko-app.netlify.app/

This app is the result of the Udemy course "The Complete JavaScript COurse 2022: From Zero to Expert" by Jonas Schmedtmann.
